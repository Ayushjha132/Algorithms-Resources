Binary Trees

Perfect Binary Trees: 
  -- Each level have twice the number of nodes than the level above
  -- sum of no. of all nodes on leaf is equal to the no of all nodes above + 1

Full Binary Trees:
  -- it will be a Binary Tree but all the level are not equal in terms of nodes each side contains.

Binary Search Tree: 
  -- right of nodes will be have greater value and left side will have smaller values.
  -- In a Binary Trees,
  -- e.g.
          -- Binary Trees --
